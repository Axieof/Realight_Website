Project Overview (Team)
# 1.	Introduction to challenge statement

Portfolio 2 and Full-stack development are modules that go hand in hand - requiring us to work on a single project as assignments of both modules. During our first Portfolio 2 lesson, we were presented with 5 challenge statements and were given the option to choose the challenge statement we were confident in pursuing



# 2.	Solutions ideated

Our first idea was an augmented reality app that can act as a more immersive way to interact with friends and family online. The idea included using 3d augmented reality technology to allow users to bring their friends and family together into their homes to replicate them actually being there. Upon realising none of us had any prior experience in augmented reality or any other remotely similar technologies, we decided that this idea would not be feasible during this time frame; we would need to self-learn all the relevant software and technologies, alongside our other school programs.

Our next idea was a sandbox building game. The idea was inspired by a game known as Garry’s mod that allows users to do anything they want to with the props in the game, involving building their own minigames and roleplaying. Minecraft was also an inspiration as minecraft’s sandbox building allows users to build anything, including recreating real life locations. We took these as an inspiration to build a sandbox building game that would allow users to build real life locations such as their house within the game so that they can invite other users online to hang out or hold events that would not be possible in real life due to the pandemic

Our next idea was a communication app that would implement features of discord and twitch. This application would allow users to make their own servers similar to discord, as well as have public servers for artists to hold concerts, people to hold online classes and families to celebrate events such as weddings or birthdays all through live streaming.

Our next idea was to implement a social media application that would bring users together based on their interests. The social media application was to be built around engaging in social activities during a pandemic through bringing people of similar interest together, helping people feel less lonely and help them pass by time staying cooped up at home.



# 3.	Final solution

The final solution we decided on was Realight. Realight was a combination of our previous ideas, by taking the best parts of them and putting them together and making them work together well. One important decision we had to make early on was whether to develop a social media application or game, as we had interest in doing both, but had not much game making experience.

Thus we ultimately decided to split Project Realight into 2 parts, a website that would serve as social media location where users could interact with each other through online chat, and a game which would be the main part of Project Realight, where users will meet up with friends and family to do anything they want with the tools provided, thus our slogan ‘A blank reality, make it yours’, suggesting to our users that they have all the power to do anything creatively as they will, and that we would not limit the user to make their world anything they want it to be.

# 4. Project Management
To manage the different user stories and tasks allocated for the project, a Trello board was created. The board allowed us to view all our tasks and organize them neatly. Multiple tabs were created, each for a different use, and user stories and tasks were shifted across the tabs to track the progress of each task and its development. To allocate the priority and the difficulty of each task, a point-based system was implemented, with each user story being assigned a point based on its importance and difficulty. 

We followed the agile scrum methodology when implementing our trello board, with the points system to prioritize user stories. We also included our own twist with sub tasks of a user story defining the technical tasks required to complete that user story. We then would set a dateline for that sub task, so that we coil manage our subtasks for a user story.
